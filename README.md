Requirements:
  -pyTorch
  -Matplotlib 

Running the file will create a linear model with random weights and biases.
We then fine tune the weights using back propogation to create a model which can predict salary expecations based on YOE. Backpropogation is done via pyTorch.
At the end you can see the graph of the model fitting the scattered points in our data.
